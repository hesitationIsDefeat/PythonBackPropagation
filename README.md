# Deep Neural Network with Backpropagation

This project is a custom Python implementation of a deep neural network, focusing on building and understanding the backpropagation algorithm. It is intended for educational purposes, providing insights into how neural networks learn by breaking down each step of the forward and backward pass.

## Features

- **Backpropagation**: Implements backpropagation from scratch, allowing training through gradient descent.
- **Flexible Architecture**: Customize the number and size of layers to experiment with different neural network architectures.
- **Activation Functions**: Supports ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh activation functions for nonlinear transformations.
